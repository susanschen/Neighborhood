## Google Map, Wikipedia and Knockout Project

This project is a combination of three courses from Udacity's front-end developer course: Google API, Intro to AJAX, and Using an Organization Library, which is Knockout.js.

### To run the app
You may download the repo, use your own Google Map API key, and open index.html, or view it online here.

### My thoughts on this project

Individually, the Google Map and Wikipedia mini-projects was easy to follow along in the course.  Combining both of them with Knockout.js is much harder than I thought. I hit many programming hurdles and with the help of Udacity's coach, Karol, I was able to make major improvements. Although I am just completing the bare minimum, I may add more features later on.
